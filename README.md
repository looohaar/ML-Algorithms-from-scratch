# ML and DL Algorithms from Scratch

Welcome to the ML and DL Algorithms from Scratch repository! This project is dedicated to implementing various machine learning and deep learning algorithms from the ground up using Python. The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of how these algorithms work by coding them without relying on high-level libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.
